== Using the Script ==
 sudo apt-get install -y git-core
 git clone https://github.com/kaldrenon/install-chef-server.git
 chmod a+x install-chef-server/*.sh
 install-chef-server/install-chef-server-mu-rvm.sh

== About ==

This script is based heavily on work done by Sam Pikesley in a similar effort that can be found [http://github.com/pikesley/catering-college here]. My <code>install-chef-server.sh</code> is more than half his doing.

In order, here are the high level bullet points of what the script does:
* Install Ruby dependencies through aptitude
* Install RVM in multi-user mode
* Create a user named chef
* Add chef to admin group
* Add chef and current user to rvm group
* Modify sudoers file to allow all admin users to sudo w/o password
* Put RVM into mixed mode so that rubies and gemsets are managed per user
* Install Ruby 1.9.3 on current user and set that version to default.
* Install Ruby 1.9.2 on chef user and set that to default.
* Run [http://github.com/pikesley pikesley]<nowiki/>'s chef-server installaction script as chef user.
